
This describes the problem of public opening of records


The problem
-----------

Suppose User1 sends RecordX to ServerA which becomes public immediately.
User2 reads RecordX, modifies field O, and sends falsified RecordY to ServerB.
ServerB publishes RecordY.
Only now (!) ServerB receives notification from ServerA about RecordX.
Servers get into conflict.


Proposed solution
-----------------

User1 sends RecordX to ServerA. ServerA adds DN to the list of hidden DNs (LHT).
User2 reads RecordX, but fields KG are replaced with 'xxx' (in both last and slices).
User2 cannot tamper the record.

ServerA sends notifications to its neighbours
ServerA receives requests from neighbours to send RecordX and replies by sending
SKC-encrypted RecordX

Upon Event0 DN is removed from LHT on ServerA.
Event0 can be defined as a sequence or a combination of other events.
For example,
Event1 - receiving SKC notification from another server;
Event2 - time lapsed since record publishing or another event;
Event3 - active confirmation of RecordX from neighbours.

Token Manager (tokmgr)
======================
User enters interactively password. TM finds suffix, so the
password becomes strengthened: pwd+sx

TM can be used as a Wallet - when internal generated hidden
password is used to control tokens instead of pwd+sx.

TM has a name and associated token (Manager's Token).

TM polls its name in drop area for any messages
(Question: how to organize queue of messages? - maybe append)

TM uses PKC for communication

TM uses an encrypted file to store its PKC and the List of TOkens (LOT)

 - read content of input slice directory (unique names) into memory                  (1)

 - for each unique name (uN) :
   {
     - create corresponding uN directory in the output index directory               (1)

     - for each meta file from slice/uN/meta directory :
       {
         - read its content into memory                                              (1)

         - for each line (slice file name) in meta file :
           {
             - read content of slice file into memory                                (1)

             - for each line (record) in slice file :
               {
                 - try to find corresponding DN file in the output index directory  (3+)

                 - if not found create one                                          (3+)

                 - use IndexReader object to collect DN file info                    (1)

                 - truncate DN file if necessary (very rare event)                  (2+)

                 - write record to DN file                                           (1)

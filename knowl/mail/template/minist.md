
Dear <Mr Vasia>

My name is Oleg Mazonka and I am the technical director 
at Hasq Technology Pty Ltd - an Adelaide-based company 
working in the field of cryptography. In 2013 we invented 
a theory for ownership of electronic tokens, which we 
believed to be of great significance to the financial 
and banking system. Based on this theory we developed 
a technology (now patented) and its implementation with 
the view of commercialising.

This technology is at the cutting edge of the fast paced 
field of cryptography where cryptocurrencies, such as 
Bitcoin, recently drew lots of attention from general 
public, academia and governments. Our technology, 
however, is different in key aspects which are 
important to government and financial organisations. 

Considering its potentially high impact on the use of 
financial instruments, we would like to present our 
technology to banks and governments. We believe that 
it allows for better government control over financial 
transactions in a highly efficient way.

I would be grateful to hear back from you and hope we can 
work together on making Australia a digitally smarter country.

Kind Regards,

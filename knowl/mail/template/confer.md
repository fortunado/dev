Hello,

I represent the interests of the company HASQ Technology Pty Ltd, which is working on the development and implementation of technology that uniquely installs and changes the owners, digital object. The digital object can be a record of any personal information, any currency, any debt etc. This mechanism appears to have the most effective tool, in the bank and financial industry. Our technology doesn’t require significant resources for work and may easily be tested with very little technical and human effort. 

This technology allows to uniquely and effectively identify the owners of the digital object and it is different from other technologies like BitCoin. This technology has a lot greater public application and a broader variety of opportunity for usage. So, in a few words, HASQ is a technology, which is anonymously recording different information. Further more, the created information remains on the web indefinitely. 

On our website, you will find a detailed description on how you can use our technology in different fields. HASQ Technology Pty Ltd is searching for an investor who is ready to invest in the development of the technology and its implementation. HASQ Technology is already protected by an Australian and international patent. Today our team consists of several Australian people, with a Russian and Ukrainian background. 

If you are interested in our proposal - we will be happy to answer any questions. Our colleagues will be glad for the opportunity to discuss possible collaboration.

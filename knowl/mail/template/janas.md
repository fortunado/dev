Dear XXX,
My name is Oleg Mazonka and I'm the technical director of Hasq Technology Pty Ltd.  I got your contact details from Dr Jana Matthews after speaking with her recently.  She suggested I contact you; as you may be interested in what we do and may give us advice on what we can do next to develop our company. 
Here is a brief description of what we have done. Back in 2013 we devised an idea of digital objects (tokens) that can be passed from one party to another in a way that only the legitimate owner has a valid copy. Being simple and elegant, the idea is still new in the world of cryptography.  It allows many practical applications: most notably, cryptocurrencies (either anonymous or fully transparent) and registries of all kinds that keep track of owners’ assets or debts. The following are the main features of our technology.
1) Token ownership transfer does not require a third party to validate/approve a transaction. At the same time the process is very secure with all possible conflicts resolved automatically. For example, if tokens represent digital banknotes, then token ownership transfer becomes equivalent of one party paying the other. Since transactions do not require a third party (bank) to be involved, tokens become a digital equivalent of cash. This application alone opens up the possibility for our technology to be used as a replacement for paper money, saving considerable resources for governments.
2) The information about all tokens and transactions is stored in a public distributed database in a way that eliminates (mathematically proven) the possibility of anyone making unauthorized changes. Only the legitimate tokens' owner can control them.
3) No electronic wallet is required for storing tokens. This makes it easier for tokens' owners to manage them. It also reduces the risk of losing tokens. This is different from the conventional approaches and comes from the fact that our technology does not use public key cryptography.
4) Theoretical ideas behind the technology are simple and easy to understand and validate by anyone with minimal mathematical knowledge.
5) The technology allows a fast practical implementation that we actually demonstrated by our product.
6) Transactions are very cheap since no high performance hardware is required.
Seeing a potential, we patented the idea in 2014 and started developing a working prototype. As of now, we have a fully developed scalable, high performance generic software solution ready to be used in commercial environment. The solution is available for anyone to download from our website: http://hasq.com. We also recently developed a demonstration example (http://tokenswap.com) where users can create and modify their tokens for research or practical purposes.
To summarize the above, we believe that we created a technology and a product that may be of significant importance to the financial and banking sectors as well as to have applications in many other fields. The issue that we face now is how to bring it to the real world, how to get people/organizations interested. While we published a number of documents and articles in the past, clearly that's not enough and that's why we need experts from outside of our company to express their opinions and advise on our further steps.
I would appreciate if you could let me know your thoughts in which direction we should go and the steps we should take. If you have time I would like to meet you in person to hear your opinion and possibly clarify other details.
Kind Regards,
Oleg Mazonka, PhD

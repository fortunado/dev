Dear XXX,

My name is Oleg Mazonka and I'm the technical director of Hasq Technology Pty Ltd - an Australian software development company, based in Adelaide. 

One of the important innovations in the field of cryptography in the recent years was blockchain technology. Originally used as a basis for Bitcoin cryptocurrency, now it attracts more attention as a tool for safe exchange of value between untrusting parties. While blockchain technology is widely recognised, there is an alternative which in many cases may provide better performance and cheaper operations. This alternative is a technology developed by our company and I would like to introduce it to you.

Here is a brief description of what has been done. Back in 2013 we devised an idea of digital objects (Hasq tokens) that can be passed from one party to the other in a way that only the legitimate owner has a valid copy. Hasq tokens can be thought of as coins in one of the blockchain-based cryptocurrencies. The difference, however, is the underlying mechanism that makes the system work. This mechanism, in principle, is described in a paper that we published in 2014 (http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.4316). The following are main features of our technology.

1) Token ownership transfer does not require a third party to validate/approve a transaction. At the same time the process is very secure with all possible conflicts resolved automatically.

2) The information about all tokens and transactions is stored in a distributed database in a way that eliminates (mathematically proven) the possibility of anyone making unauthorized changes. Only the legitimate tokens' owner can control them.

3) No public key cryptography is used, hash functions only. This greatly simplifies and significantly speeds up internal calculations. Potentially, this also makes our system more secure in comparison with public key cryptography based solutions.

4) There is no limit on a number of tokens in the system.

5) No electronic wallet is required for storing tokens. Not only this makes it easier for tokens' owners to manage them, but also reduces the risk of losing tokens.

6) Theoretical ideas behind the technology are simple and easy to understand and validate by anyone with minimal mathematical knowledge.

7) The technology allows a fast practical implementation that we actually demonstrated by our product.

8) Transactions are very cheap since no high performance hardware is required.

9) Transactions allow a “hold on” state in which neither receiving nor sending party has full control.

Seeing the technology's potential, we patented it in 2014 and started developing a working prototype. As of now, we have a fully developed, scalable high performance generic software solution ready to be used in commercial environment. The solution is available for anyone to download from our website http://hasq.com. We have also recently developed a demonstration example (http://tokenswap.com) where users can create and modify their tokens for research or practical purposes.

To summarize the above, we believe that we have created a technology and a product that may be of significant importance to the financial and banking sectors as well as to have applications in many other fields. While the core engine of the technology is completed, field-specific front ends and protocols may be needed in order to satisfy different industries' requirements. This is where we see potential for cooperation with companies like yours. I hope you find Hasq technology interesting and deserving some attention. Please don't hesitate to ask any questions, we are open to communicating with anyone who wants to know more about Hasq technology. Thank you for your time.

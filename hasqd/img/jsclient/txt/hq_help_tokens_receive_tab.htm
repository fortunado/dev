<p>"Send" and "Receive" tabs contain controls that are used by a user when they wish to pass 
tokens\' ownership to another person or to accept a new token from somebody else.

<p>There are 4 scenarios how ownership can be 
transferred. Scenarios 1 and 3 assume that the current token owner initiate the steps 
necessary to change the ownership. Pressing buttons "Initiate", "Initiate Step 1" and 
"Initiate Step 2" generate hex strings that should by passed to a new token owner via 
any communication channel.

<p>Upon receiveing the generated hex strings, the new token owner should insert them into 
the corresponding fields in the "Receive" tab and press one of "Finalize", "Finalize Step 1"
or "Finalize Step 2" buttons. Pressing the button either finalizes token ownership 
transfer or initiates the second step.

<p>Scenarios 2 and 4 are similar to scenarios 1 and 3 with the difference being the new 
token owner initiating the token ownership transfer.

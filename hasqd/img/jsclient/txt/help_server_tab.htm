The lower part of the tab window contains a table of neighbouring Hasq servers connected to the current server. A mouse click on any of the links in the table causes the Client to connect to the corresponding server. Information in all of the Client\'s tabs will be updated accordingly. This feature allows for exploration of the network of servers that the current server belongs to.

<p>This tab provides users with a handy hash calculator. The types of hash functions supported include MD5, RIPEMD-160, SHA2-256, SHA2-512 and WORD.</P>
<p>WORD is a Hasq own hash type. Records built with the use of WORD are short, which makes them easy to read/print. This makes WORD an ideal hash type for anyone who wants to better understand how records link to each other and needs to use hashes in their calculations/modelling. WORD can also be used by developers as a temporary replacement for other hashes while they debug their source code. Due to the short length of WORD hashes (4 characters only), other real life applications are limited.</P>
<p>The type of hash used by the calculator can be chosen by pressing a button at the top of the tab window. Text data whose hash value needs to be calculated should be typed in or copied into the area directly below the button. Every time the content of this area changes, its hash value is calculated and displayed in the window below.</P>
<p>Three buttons at the bottom of the tab window are provided for user convenience. They copy the calculated hash value into the Key, Generator or Owner fields located in the "Records" tab. This may be handy if a user needs to manually calculate hash values for those fields.</P>

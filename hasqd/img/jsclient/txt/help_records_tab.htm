<p>This tab is used to manipulate records in the chosen database. The name of the current database is shown at the top left corner of the tab window.</P>
<p>Two operations with records can be performed here - extraction of the last record in a chain and creation of a new record.</P>
<p>Either operation requires a DN (token) to be specified first. A DN can be typed directly in the [DN] window or automatically generated from the content of the [Raw DN] field above. Since any DN is a hash-like string, some checks are performed if the [DN] field is changed manually. The purpose of the checks is to prevent incorrect characters from being used in a hash as well as to make sure that the length of a string in the [DN] field matches the length of a hexadecimal text representation of the database"s hash. If there is no match, a red frame will be displayed around the [DN] field. The same applies to all other editable fields where a hash-like string is expected. For example, if the databases hash is MD5, the content of the [DN] field must be 32 characters long.</P>
<p>Pressing the [Get Last Record] button causes the Client to send a request to the server to extract the last record for the DN specified in the [DN] field. If the request is fulfilled successfully, the components of the extracted record (Record number, Key, Generator, Owner and Data) will be displayed in the corresponding fields on the right hand side of the button. The status of the operation (success or failure) will be shown at the bottom of the tab window.</P>
<p>The lower part of the window contains controls for creating a new record for the DN shown in the [DN] field above. These include fields for the record"s passwords and for the record"s components. All of the component fields can be edited manually or filled in automatically.</P>
<p>Key, Generator and Owner hashes can be produced with the help of passwords. There are two options available: one password for all three components or a separate password for each component. Two checkboxes in the lower part of the window are provided for switchingbetween these options.</P>
<p>Typing in the password fields causes the Client to produce Key, Generator and Owner components of the new record. The newly generated values will be displayed in the corresponding fields above the [Submit] button.</P>
<p>Once the components of the new record are known (either generated automatically or entered manually), the Client checks if this record can be linked to the previous record in a chain. A message, containing the result of the check is displayed at the bottom of the tab window. The Client may not have enough information to perform such a check in which case the corresponding message is also displayed. If, however, the check returns a negative result, a red frame around the [Submit] button will be shown. A green frame indicates that the check was successful. Pressing the [Submit] button causes the Client to send a command to the server to add a new record to the DN"s chain. The result of this command (success or failure) will be displayed at the bottom of the window.</P>

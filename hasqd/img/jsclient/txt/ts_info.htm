<i><b>What is a token?</b></i>
A token is a digital object. It has a name and a hash.
The token\'s name is any text or file; and the token\'s hash 
is a hexadecimal string of a certain length, generated from its name.
For example, a token name "abc" generates the following 
hash "6ea923f0bba18e2a736ecae8cb61ff78".

Each token is controlled by a master key. Many tokens
can be controlled by the same master key.

The owner of the token can make changes to associated data.
This data is publicly available to everyone.

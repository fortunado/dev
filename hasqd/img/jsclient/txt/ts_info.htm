This is a place where you can create your own tokens, associate 
data with them, pass the ownership to another person, or to 
receive the ownership from somebody else. If you need help, try 
clicking on a widget (text or picture), it may bring a popup 
window with an explanation.

<i><b>What is a token?</b></i>
A token is a digital object. It has a name and a hash.
The token\'s name is any text or file; and the token\'s hash 
is a hexadecimal string of a certain length, generated from its name.
For example, a token name "abc" generates the following 
hash "6ea923f0bba18e2a736ecae8cb61ff78".

<p style="text-align: left;">
Each token is controlled by a master key. And many tokens
can be controlled by the same master key.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
<b>What is the master key?</b> The master key is a secure password to 
control your tokens. It is not shared if you pass your token 
to another person. The master key is not stored anywhere and if 
it is complex (long and random) it cannot be recovered. If you 
forget the master key, the token will remain forever because no one 
would be able to control it.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
<b>How to change the master key?</b> The only way to change a password 
for a particular token is to pass the token to yourself using 
"Give" and "Receive" buttons using a different master key. For 
a detailed explanation click on the title "Master key".

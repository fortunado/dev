This is a place where you can create your own tokens, associate 
data with them, pass the ownership to another person, or to 
receive the ownership from somebody else. If you need help, try 
clicking on a widget (text or picture), it will bring a popup 
window with an explanation.

<i><b>What is a token?</b></i>
A token is a digital object. It has a name and a hash.
The token\'s name is any text or file; and the token\'s hash 
is a hexadecimal string of a certain length, generated from its name.
For example, a token name "abc" generates the following 
hash "6ea923f0bba18e2a736ecae8cb61ff78".
</p>
<hr/>

<p style="text-align: left;">
Each token is controlled by a master key. Many tokens
can be controlled by the same master key.
</p>
<hr/>

<p style="text-align: left;">
The owner of the token can make changes to associated data.
This data is publicly available to everyone.

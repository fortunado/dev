<i><b>What is the master key?</b></i> 
The master key is a secure password which validates ownership and controls the tokens.
It is not shared if you pass your token 
to another person. The master key is not stored anywhere and if 
it is complex (long and random) it cannot be recovered. If you 
forget the master key, the token will remain as is
forever because there would be no control over it.

<i><b>WARNING!</b></i>
The way passwords are used here is different from other services.
TokenSwap (Hasq technology) works with open databases - a public ledger.
This means that the passwords <i>WILL</i> effectively 
be challanged for each token.
Only complex passwords ensure security of your ownership.
The hint below serves only as a guide for the password complexity, 
but is only an estimation.

<i><b>How to change the master key?</b></i>
The only way to change a password 
for a particular token is to pass the token to yourself by
"Give" and "Receive" buttons using a different master key.

<i><b>What is the master key?</b></i> 
Master key is a password which validates ownership of tokens.
(The master key is a secure password to 
control your tokens. ) FIXME
It is not shared if you pass your token 
to another person. The master key is not stored anywhere and if 
it is complex (long and random) it cannot be recovered. If you 
forget the master key, the token will remain forever because no one 
would be able to control it.

<i><b>WARNING!</b></i>
The way how passwords are used here is different from other services.
TokenSwap (Hasq technology) works with open databases - a public ledger.
This means that the passwords <i>WILL</i> effectively 
be challanged for each token.
Only complex passwords ensure security of your ownership.
The hint below serves only as a guide for password complexity, but
not a strict proof.

<i><b>How to change the master key?</b></i>
The only way to change a password 
for a particular token is to pass the token to yourself by
"Give" and "Receive" buttons using a different master key.

<p>The "Tokens" tab provides a user with an option to manipulate tokens (DNs) at a higher level. Five operations are permitted - "Create", "Verify", "Data", "Send" and "Receive". Each operation will be performed for a group of tokens specified in the top text area. If some of the tokens in a group are invalid, a corresponding error message will be displayed.
<p>Tokens can be added to a group manually (hash or raw value in square brackets) or with the use of a token range generator located below the top text area.
<p>A password, specified in the field below the range generator, will be used for every token in the group.

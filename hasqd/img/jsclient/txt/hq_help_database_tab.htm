<p>The Hasq server may have a number of databases that it maintains. 
When the Client first connects to a server, it requests a list 
of databases located on this server. It then selects the first 
database to be current. Any user command (except direct commands 
issued in the Command tab) is performed on the current database.

<p>This tab allows users to change the current database. This 
is achieved by clicking on the button at the top of the tab 
window and choosing a name from the list. The table below the 
button contains properties (traits) of the chosen database. 
While all properties are important, some of them are more 
informative for users than others. These include the database 
name, hash type (e.g. MD5) used by this database, and 
the record"s data limit.

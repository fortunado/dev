Welcome to TokenSwap. This is a place where you can create your own tokens, associate data with them, pass the ownership to another person, or to receive the ownership from somebody else. A token is a hash taken from any text or file. The master key is a secure password to control your tokens. It is not shared if you pass your token to another person.
